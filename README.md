# Cognitive-Reaction-Analyzer

The **Cognitive Reaction Analyzer** project investigates the intersection of action and cognition by measuring reaction times in response to a visual stimulus. This project explores how physical actions, such as pressing a key after seeing a visual cue, affect cognitive processes like attention, perception, and reaction time.

This study aligns closely with research in cognitive neuroscience, particularly focusing on how mental health influences cognitive function, especially in terms of reaction time. The project aims to provide insights into how individuals with different mental health statuses may respond to cognitive tasks.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze reaction time as a measure of cognitive processing speed and explore how mental health influences cognitive abilities. The analysis shows that individuals with better mental health tend to have quicker reaction times compared to those with poorer mental health, based on trials from multiple participants.

## Key Findings

- **Faster Reaction Time in Healthy Individuals**: Participants with better mental health consistently demonstrated quicker reaction times compared to those with poorer mental health.
- **Action-Cognition Link**: This research highlights the role of physical actions (pressing the key) in cognitive performance, reflecting how mental states influence cognitive processing speed.

## Features

- **Reaction Time Measurement**: Measures how long it takes for a participant to respond to a "Go!" signal after a random delay.
- **Participant Data**: Collects reaction time data from multiple participants to analyze the relationship between mental health and reaction speed.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots the reaction times for each trial, providing a clear visual representation of individual performance.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For running the analysis and collecting participant data.
- **Pandas**: To manage and analyze the reaction time data.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results of the reaction times.

## How It Works

1. **Participant Setup**: A participant is asked to press the "Enter" key as quickly as possible after seeing a "Go!" signal.
2. **Data Collection**: The reaction time is recorded for each trial, and data is stored for further analysis.
3. **Analysis**: The data is analyzed to determine patterns in reaction time based on the mental health status of the participants.
4. **Visualization**: A graph is generated to visualize the reaction times for each participant over multiple trials.

## Result

**Good mental health**

## Future Work

This project could be expanded to:
- Investigate additional cognitive metrics such as attention span and memory recall.
- Explore different types of stimuli to see how they affect reaction time.
- Further analyze the impact of mental health on other cognitive processes, including decision-making and problem-solving.

## Conclusion

The **Cognitive Reaction Analyzer** provides valuable insights into how mental health impacts cognitive processes, specifically reaction time. By aligning the project with research on cognition and physical actions, it deepens our understanding of how mental states influence cognitive performance.
